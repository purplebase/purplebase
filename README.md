# purplebase

A high level, strongly typed nostr client for Dart.

## Design goals

 - Leverage the Dart language to provide maximum type safety and beautiful interfaces that make sense
 - Allow consuming nostr events using domain language and not NIP technicality
 - Allow access to lower level interfaces
 - Allow defining new classes in an intuitive way
